                <h3>This website was meticulously crafted as a part of my individual project for a bootcamp. It is a video game page that allows you to navigate through a ton of pages with different games and information about them. I used advanced technologies such as React with Redux for the front-end and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the back-end. This project showcases a blend of cutting-edge web development skills and a deep passion for creating innovative solutions.</h3>
